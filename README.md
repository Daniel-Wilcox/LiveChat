# LiveChat

LiveChat is a clone of the chat feature from [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) or [Discord](https://discord.com/) 👾

The goal is to learn [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (backend w/ [API](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)) as well as [React](https://reactjs.org/) (frontend, possibly done with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)).

## Functionality

So how will this application work?

1. User registration:

   - Username 📛
   - email + email confirmation 📤
   - Password 🛂
   - Date of birth 👶
   - Profile icon 🚀

2. Chat room:

   - User creates/hosts a room 🏠
   - User joins room from link (public)
   - Chat (on click or enter) and marks user's timestamp
   - Username, icon, channel icon, local time displayed
   - Host can auth mod's, both can ban users or remove comment (from chat+log)

**These are subject to change as the project progresses.**
